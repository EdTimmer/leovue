<div class='content'><p>Leo Viewer can load .leo files into nodes in a parent .leo file.</p>
<p>The child node of this node has the following title:</p>
<pre><code>[Example](example.leo)
</code></pre>
<p>Since the title points to a .leo file, the leo file is loaded into the node when the node is clicked.</p>
<p>The subtree isnâ€™t loaded until you click on the node, so outlines can contain many child outlines and still have fast page load.</p>
