<div class='content'><p>Content items in Leo outlines can be code.</p>
<p>To mark content as code, put the following in the first line of the node content:</p>
<p><span class='directive'>@language languagename</span></p>
<p>for example:</p>
<p><span class='directive'>@language javascript</span></p>
<p>When Leo Viewer encounters a node with a language directive as the first line, it displays formatted code, unless the language is ‘html’ or ‘md’ in which case Leo Viewer displays the output view, not the source.</p>
