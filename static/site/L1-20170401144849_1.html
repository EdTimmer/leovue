<div class='content'><div class="text">You can create nodes that point to external sites.

To do this, create a node with a Markdown link in the title, for example:

[This is a link](http://www.example.com)

Leo Viewer will show the external site in the content pane.

The next node has the following title:

[A URL Node](https://kaleguy.github.io/simpleng2admin/#/home)

Note that if Leo Viewer is served via https (e.g. Github Pages) only https links will work here.

The second node in this section has the following title:

[Feature Introduction](https://kaleguy.github.io/leo-tutorials/feature-introduction.md)

This is a clone of one of the earlier nodes in this outline. In this case Leo Viewer fetches the document and 
converts it to HTML before displaying it.</div></div></body>
