<div class='content'><h1>Installing and Using Leo Viewer</h1>
<p>To use Leo Viewer, copy the files in the <a href="https://github.com/kaleguy/leoviewer">dist folder at github</a> to your server. A web server is
required, you can’t simply open Leo Viewer from your local file system. If you want to view
files on your local machine without a server, use a node utility like ‘http-server’.</p>
<p>You will be able to open Leo Viewer by opening index.html in your browser. If you are not
serving Leo Viewer from the root of your domain, you’ll need to first edit the “base” tag in
index.html.</p>
<p>About setting the base, for example, the file you are reading is
hosted on Github Pages at <a href="https://kaleguy.github.io/leoviewer/">https://kaleguy.github.io/leoviewer/</a>.
So the base tag for the index.html for this installation of Leo Viewer looks like this:</p>
<p><code>&lt;base href='/leoviewer/'&gt;</code></p>
<p>You can also run Leo Viewer from github pages. Fork the repository on Github,
then go to Settings - Github pages and choose ‘master branch - docs folder’. The file ‘docs.leo’ in the docs/static folder will
be viewable at <a href="http://username.github.io/myforkname/">username.github.io/myforkname/</a>. (But be sure to edit the base tag as described above).</p>
<p>The leo file that Leo Viewer displays is located at ‘static/docs.leo’. You can open this leo file using the Leo program and edit it,
or replace it with your own file. Currently the name of this file is not configurable, this feature will be added in the next release.</p>
<p>For a quick look at a Leo file, you can also drag and drop the file on to Leo Viewer.</p>
