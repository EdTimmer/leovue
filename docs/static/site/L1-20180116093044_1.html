<div class='content'><h1>Kanban</h1>
<p>Some people find Leo outlines to be a good way to organize to-do lists and projects.</p>
<p>However, if you have your projects in Leo, you still might want to be able to display a level of your project list as a Kanban board, so that others can easily see that sectionâ€™s progress.</p>
<p>Using the @kanban directive, you can create a kanban board from a node. The next level node become the columns of the boards, and the lower levels are displayed in the nested viewer.</p>
<p>The nested viewer component makes it possible to display just the selected parts of a tree, so a large subtree can be viewable in a single kanban column.</p>
