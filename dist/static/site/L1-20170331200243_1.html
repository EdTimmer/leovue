<div class='content'><h1>About Leo</h1>
<p>Leo is a unique text editor and IDE that facilitates a new way of looking at text documents, including code files.</p>
<p>The purpose of this document is to make a very brief introduction to creating tree based content with Leo and
displaying it with Leo Viewer. Leo has features that make it particularly suitable for creating
documentation of code.</p>
<p>More advanced users of Leo are able to use Leo to practice a type of “Literate Programming”, that is, a style of
programming where documentation comes first, and code is generated from the documentation or
is developed in tandem with it.</p>
