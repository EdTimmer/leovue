<div class='content'><h1>Installing and Using Leo Viewer</h1>
<p>To use Leo Viewer, copy the files in the <a href="https://github.com/kaleguy/leoviewer">dist folder at github</a> to your server. A web server is
required, you can’t simply open Leo Viewer from your local file system. If you want to view
files on your local machine without a server, use a node utility like ‘http-server’.</p>
<p>You will be able to open Leo Viewer by opening index.html in your browser. If you are not
serving Leo Viewer from the root of your domain, you’ll need to first edit the “base” tag in
index.html.</p>
<sectionlink :title="' More about the base tag '"/>
<br>
<sectionlink :title="' Running Leo Viewer from Github '"/>
<p>The leo file that Leo Viewer displays is located at ‘static/docs.leo’. You can edit this leo file using the Leo program
or replace it with your own file. You can change the name of the leo file that is loaded by editing the configuration
parameters in index.html.</p>
<p>For a quick look at a Leo file, you can also drag and drop the file on to Leo Viewer.</p>
